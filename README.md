## 🚀 About Codeminati

Codeminati is a full-stack competitive programming and hackathon hosting platform engineered to simulate real contest environments with live leaderboards, secure code execution, and strict role-based control.

It enables organizers to conduct professional coding events while allowing participants to compete in a seamless, real-time environment.

## 🧠 Core Principle

> Problems solved during contests or hackathons are never marked as solved in the global practice section.

This ensures:
- Fair competition
- Accurate rankings
- Isolation between practice and competition data
- True contest integrity
